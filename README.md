Welcome to WeLunch, a new social experience from Yelp and Tomorrow's Modern Lunches Co.

We've overhauled our algorithms, we've machined our learning, and we're ready to deliver on our promises to revolutionize food by expanding our horizons with innovative social methods. Now, you can share your TML-generated meals with friends; develop and post your own recipes recreating our hand-crafted robot food; and, in an unprecedented act of trust that is absolutely not a matter of dwindling creativity among our E-suite, users will be able to suggest new ingredients! These will be focus-tested within WeLunch, and the data gathered will go toward developing new flavor combinations at our recently-rebuilt robot arm factory.

We hope you're ready to see all the improvements we've made to our model, including:
- replacing stars with "thumbs up"
- there are still five of them
- and so much more!

WeLunch launches in private pre-alpha today, and we hope you'll all sign in with your main email accounts for non-specific reasons!
